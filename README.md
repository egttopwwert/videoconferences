## About The Project

For the past year, there is a sharp rise in the count of online schools and web services because of COVID-19. This resulted in an urgent need for high-quality and not resource-intensive video communications. But all the existing solutions are too expensive or not efficient and require lots of improvements. This project is a way out of this dilemma.

Here is why:
* Your time should be focused on creating a project that solves a problem and helps others, but not on the technical realization of videoconferences. It has already been done for you!
* There is no need to pay a lot for adding real-time video communications to your web service. It is absolutely free!
* This project uses a modular architecture. It allows to integrate this project into real web services easily and to add new features without any troubles.

### Built with
